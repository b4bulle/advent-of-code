# Day 2: Gift Shop

See [exercise](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2)

Here are my thoughts on how I handled it :

### Likes

* Use of Regex made it really easy for part 2 (1 character difference)
* Got an infinite loop that made me remember that nothing is too simple

### Dislikes

* Went in overly complex code to create a structure where I ordered the IDs ranges. I thought I would have a use for this, turns out it was a waste of time.
* Didn't bother to test since it worked rapidly
