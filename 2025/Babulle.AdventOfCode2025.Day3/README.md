# Day 3: Lobby

See [exercise](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/3)

Some thoughts :

* Did part 1 by creating a regex checking for 99 in line, then 98, ... And that for each line. 
It worked but the same method was way too long for part 2.
I have to check regexes to know if it was possible with a single, more elegant one.
* For part 2, I went with another method that did work after LOTS of fidgetting with indices.
